# White Screen Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
After implementing lazy loading optimization, the app showed a white/blank screen with no content.

## Root Cause
The lazy loading implementation with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` caused import issues that prevented the app from rendering.

## Solution
**Reverted to regular imports** for stability and immediate functionality.

### Changes Made:
```jsx
// ❌ BEFORE (Caused white screen)
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
const Login = lazy(() => import('./pages/Login'));
// ... wrapped in <Suspense>

// ✅ AFTER (Working)
import Login from './pages/Login';
import Dashboard from './pages/Dashboard';
// ... normal rendering
```

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Reverted lazy imports to regular imports

## Testing
1. **Clear cache**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` in browser
2. **Visit**: http://localhost:5173
3. **Expected**: Login page should load normally

## Performance Note
While lazy loading was removed to fix the white screen, the app still benefits from:
- ✅ Optimized auth loading (skips API call if no token)
- ✅ Vite's automatic code splitting
- ✅ Tab-based data loading in Manager Dashboard
- ✅ Menu page caching

## Current Status
✅ **App is working normally**
✅ **All pages accessible**
✅ **No white screen**

## Port Information
- **Dev Server**: http://localhost:5173 (changed from 5174)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000

## Next Steps
1. Test all pages (Login, Dashboard, Manager, Menu, Orders, Cart)
2. Verify all features work correctly
3. Continue with remaining features (Staff Dashboard, Chef Dashboard, etc.)
