### 2. No Camera Found

**Error Message:** "No camera device found. Please connect a camera and try again."

**Solution:**
1. **Check Physical Connection:**
   - Ensure your webcam is properly connected to your computer
   - If using an external webcam, try unplugging and reconnecting it
   - Check if the camera is enabled in Device Manager (Windows)

2. **Check Device Manager (Windows):**
   - Press `Win + X` and select "Device Manager"
   - Expand "Cameras" or "Imaging devices"
   - If your camera has a yellow warning icon, right-click and select "Update driver"
   - If disabled, right-click and select "Enable device"

3. **Test Camera in Other Apps:**
   - Try opening the Windows Camera app to verify the camera works
   - Open `camera` from Start menu

### 3. Camera Already in Use

**Error Message:** "Camera is currently being used by another application."

**Solution:**
1. **Close Other Applications:**

### 4. Browser Not Supported

**Error Message:** "Your browser doesn't support camera access."

**Solution:**
1. **Use HTTPS:**
   - Camera access requires HTTPS in modern browsers
   - For local development, `localhost` is automatically treated as secure
   - If accessing from another device, use HTTPS or configure browser exceptions

2. **Update Your Browser:**
   - Ensure you're using a modern, updated browser
   - Recommended browsers:
     - Chrome 53+
     - Firefox 36+
     - Safari 11+
     - Edge 79+

3. **Check Browser Settings:**
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Ensure camera permissions are not globally blocked in browser settings

---

### 5. Camera Low Quality or Not Working

**Error Message:** "Failed to meet video constraints" or poor image quality

**Solution:**
1. **Check Camera Resolution:**
   - The system requires at least 640x480 resolution
   - Check your camera specifications
   - Try using a different camera if available

2. **Lighting Issues:**
   - Ensure you're in a well-lit area
   - Face the light source (window or lamp)
   - Avoid backlighting (light behind you)

3. **Camera Focus:**
   - Position yourself 1-2 feet from the camera
   - Ensure the camera can focus on your face
   - Clean the camera lens if necessary

## Testing Your Camera

### Test in Browser Console

1. Open your browser's Developer Console (F12)
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Paste this code and press Enter:

```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    console.log('Camera access successful!', stream);
    stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Camera access failed:', error.name, error.message);
  });
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Success: "Camera access successful!" message
- ❌ Error: Shows specific error name (NotAllowedError, NotFoundError, etc.)

### Test Camera Devices

List available cameras:

```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()
  .then(devices => {
    const cameras = devices.filter(d => d.kind === 'videoinput');
    console.log(`Found ${cameras.length} camera(s):`, cameras);
  });
```
